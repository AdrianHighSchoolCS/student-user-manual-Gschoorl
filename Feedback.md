## Feedback
<p>I prefer to receive feedback: Whatever works best, as long as the feedback is honest and intelligent, I'm flexible.</p>
<p>If you are going to correct me: Do it immediately, I want to be corrected if I am wrong.</p>
<p>If you are going to tell me I'm doing something wrong, phrase it this way:Be blunt, tell me what I am doing wrong and don't sugar coat it.</p>
<p>If you want to praise me: Do it however you like.</p>
<p>It is important to me that feedback is: Honest and constructive. I want to be told what I can improve on and how to be better in the future, I want to be the best I can.</p>
